== Description ==

iE CSS and SCRIPT Definer allows you to define CSS or SCRIPT code targeted to specific versions of internet explorer. This allows on the fly editing and fine tuning of design anomalies that are common with iE. Using commented conditionals that ie reads and understands, one can now target a range of or specific versions if iE to apply the custom fixes. This saves a great deal of time as extra separate css or js files are cumbersome when small fixes are needed.

upload ie-css-definer.zip in plugin 'Add New' page.
